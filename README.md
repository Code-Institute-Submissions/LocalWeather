## UX

### Project goals

The **goal** is to create an **weather app** that is **beautiful** to look at and **easy** to **navigate.** 

#### User goals
* Let users **see** the current **weather** in **their city.**

* Let user **choose** from **popular** cities to **display** weather from.

#### Site owner goals
* Create a **website** that is visually **appealing.**
* Create a **website** that is **easy** to use.

#### User stories
* As a **user** I want the **weather** app to be **easy** to use.
* As a **user** I want the **weather data** to be **presented** to me in a **visually appealing** way.
* as a **user** I want to be **able** to **choose** which **city** I want to **display** weather **info** from.

## User requirements and expectations

### Reguirements
* The **website** needs to be **fully** responsive.
* The **weather** info needs to be **easy** to understand.
* The **website** needs to be **visually appealing.**

### Expectations
* There **should** not be **too much** information **presented** at the **same** time.
* It **should** be **easy** to **navigate** the **website.**

### Colors

When I **think** about the **weather** the color **blue** pops into my head. **Perhaps** it is **because** the **sky** is **blue.** The **color scheme** I **chose** to go with this **project** is **blue,** like the **sky.**

### Styling

For the **styling** of this **website** I'm using the foundation of **Bootstrap** alongside with **custom styling.**

### Background

The **background** for this **website** is created with [getwaves.io](https://getwaves.io/) and **Photoshop.**
